# Python File Handling Assignments

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- This script opens and reads the content of `sample.txt`.
- If the file does not exist, it handles the error gracefully and prints an error message.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- This script takes user input, writes it to `output.txt`
-  appends additional data
-   displays the final content of the file.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run each script (`read_handleerror.py` and `append_data.py`) for desired output.
